# Encrypter

This small encrypter gives user chance to encrypt and decrypt messages with Caesar cipher

User is prompterd for string and number for the step in transformation on alphabets.

Later on features will be added and overall usage is being worked on. This is new and my first project I'm doing from scratch.
Features will include decrypting messages which have unknown steps, creating cues for decryption and making own alphabets for encrypting.
